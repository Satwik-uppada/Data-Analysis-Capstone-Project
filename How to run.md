## Project Overview

The "Amazon Product Sales Analysis" project aims to analyze sales data from Amazon to derive valuable insights into pricing strategies, sales performance, and customer behavior across different product categories. The project utilizes Python and various libraries for data manipulation, visualization, and statistical analysis.

## Project Setup and Installation

### Step 1: Install Python

If Python is not already installed, download and install the latest version of Python from the official website: [Python Official Website](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

### Step 2: Install Jupyter Notebook

Jupyter Notebook will be used as the primary environment for running the project. Install Jupyter Notebook using pip, the Python package manager, by running the following command in the terminal or command prompt:

```bash
pip install jupyter
```

### Step 3: Install Required Libraries

The project requires several Python libraries for data manipulation, visualization, and statistical analysis. Install the necessary libraries using the following commands:

```bash
pip install pandas
pip install numpy
pip install matplotlib
pip install seaborn
```

## Running the Project

### Step 1: Clone the Project Repository

Clone the project repository from GitHub to your local machine using Git. If Git is not installed, download and install it from the official website: [Git Official Website](https://git-scm.com/)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Satwik-uppada/Data-Analysis-Capstone-Project.git
```

### Step 2: Navigate to the Project Directory

Navigate to the project directory using the terminal or command prompt:

```bash
cd Data-Analysis-Capstone-Project
```

### Step 3: Launch Jupyter Notebook

Launch Jupyter Notebook by running the following command in the terminal or command prompt:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

This will open Jupyter Notebook in your default web browser.

### Step 4: Open the Project Notebook

In Jupyter Notebook, navigate to the project directory and open the main project notebook, typically named "EDA Project.ipynb".

### Step 5: Run the Notebook Cells

Run each cell in the notebook sequentially to execute the code and generate the analysis, visualizations, and insights.

## Conclusion
